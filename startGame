+ &quot;This is the classic game of snakes and ladders.&quot;
+ &quot;\n&quot;
+ &quot;The rules and instructions are simple and are as

follows:&quot;

+ &quot;\n&quot;
+ &quot;1. Take turns spinning the spinner&quot;
+ &quot;\n&quot;
+ &quot;2. The player will move the amount of spots

spinned.&quot;

+ &quot;\n&quot;
+ &quot;3. If the player lands on a ladder, it will get to

move to a new higher location&quot;

+ &quot;\n&quot;
+ &quot;4. If the player lands on a snake, it will fall down

to a new location&quot;

+ &quot;\n&quot;
+ &quot;5. The game is won when a player goes over or

reaches location 100&quot;
